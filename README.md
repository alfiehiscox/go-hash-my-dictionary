# Exploration of Hashing and Hash Tables

## Goals
- Implement a Hash Table from scratch (closed-addressed and open-addressed)
- Learning about hash functions
- Use said Hash Table in a project like scenario

## Project 

*Canoicalisation* project - Given a list of dictionary words *D*, and a set of letters *S* find all the words in *D* that can be made out of letters in *S*. Use a canonical forms for each word and hashing in order to make this search efficient. As a follow up question, which set of *k* letters can be used to make the *most* dictionary words?

With the above goals in mind, write a CLI tool where the user can give sets of letters and will receive the words that can be made by them. Addiontally, given a max command and a *k* value return the set of *k* letters that makes the *most* dictionary words.
